# Server Buster


## Bot Account

In order to run the code and destroy some servers, you must first create a half-decent, passable bot account and grab its token at the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Create an application, name it whatever you wish, go to the bot section and enable all intents. Generate and paste the token of the bot into the `config.js` file.

## Running

Paste your ID into the OWNERID field of the config file. Also, before you run the code, make sure you have both **discord.js** and **colors** installed. In order to install those, run `npm i discord.js` and `npm i colors` (separately) on your terminal. That's about it. The trigger command is funny.
